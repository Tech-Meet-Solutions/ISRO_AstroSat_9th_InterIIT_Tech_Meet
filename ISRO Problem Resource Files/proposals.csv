A02_005,Longlook Observations of Three Blazars,"We propose to observe three blazars, namely, Mrk 421, 1ES 1959+650, and 3C 454.3 continuously for 100 ks each with SXT, and repeat the same observations later in the cycle. Using additional archival light curves, we shall precisely determine the X-ray power spectral density (PSD) at hours to years timescales. While detailed X-ray PSD of several Seyfert galaxies --- where the X-rays are from the accretion disk-corona region --- have been obtained before, that of blazars is much rarer. We shall search for any characteristic timescale (e.g., a break) in the PSD and hence test if such patterns translate from the accretion disk to jet. This work will help put additional constraints on the disk-jet connection in AGN. Correlation of multi-band variability from other instruments will provide clues about the mechanism of short-timescale variability in jets possibly driven by radiation loss and turbulence.",Reg,ritaban,T01,Mrk421,11 4 27.314,38 12 31.788,100000.0,sxt
A02_006,X-ray/UV occultations in NGC1365,"We request four 25ks AstroSat observations of NGC1365 with UVIT as the primary instrument. NGC1365 is a Seyfert 1.8 galaxy well known for extraordinary variations of X-ray absorption on short and long timescales. NGC1365 frequently exhibits X-ray eclipses, possibly by the broad-line region clouds, on hours timescale. It also shows Compton-thin to Compton-thick transitions on months-to-years timescale. These dramatic X-ray absorption variations have never been studied in conjunction with optical and ultraviolet observations, to search for associated flux and colour variations in these bands. The main aim of this proposal is to study in detail the X-ray absorption variability of this source, and to search for accompanying variations in the optical spectrum and optical/UV colours with coordinated AstroSat/SALT observations. The proposed observations will also probe if there is a connection between the hard X-ray continuum and the low energy X-ray absorption, and thus to separate absorption and intrinsic X--ray variability.",monitoring,gulabd,T01,NGC1365,3 33 36.372,-36 8 25.440,54000.0,uvit1
A02_008,AstroSAT observations of the next transient X-ray binary in the globular cluster Terzan 5,"The globular cluster Terzan 5 contains numerous transient low-mass X-ray binaries. At least three of these have undergone X-ray outbursts over the past 15 years, showing a variety of intriguing behaviours. We propose a 40 ks AstroSAT observation of the next bright outburst from Terzan 5, to measure its X-ray energy spectrum, characterize its power spectrum, search for pulsations, and study any X-ray bursts that occur.",AToO,cheinke,T01,Terzan 5,17 48 04.80,-24 46 45,40000.0,laxpc1
A02_024,Distinguishing absorption-induced and intrinsic variability in NGC 4388 with ASTROSAT,"We request to observe one bright Seyfert 2 AGN, NGC 4388 for 50 ks with ASTROSAT/SXT, LAXPC and UVIT. The existing RXTE observation of NGC 4388 revealed variability in the absorption column density by a factor of 10 on timescales of 4 hours. As the soft X-ray (E<3 keV) emission is very sensitive to absorption by the circumnuclear material, the study of the hard X-ray emission above 3 keV is the only way to investigate the central engine of the Seyfert 2 galaxy which is obscured by the surrounding torus. The primary goal of the proposed observation is to investigate the nature of the energy and rms spectra below and above 10 keV in order to distinguish between the variability caused by the direct nuclear emission and absorption due to the BLR clouds and/or molecular torus. This study will allow us to test the universality of the AGN unification scheme.",Reg,labani,T01,NGC 4388,12 25 46.747,12 39 43.524,50000.0,sxt
A02_027,"ASTROSAT observation of the accretion disk, corona and companion star in Her X-1","Her X-1 is to be intensely observed by UVIT, SXT, LAXPC, and CZTI instruments for one full binary during main high state. The neutron star illuminates the companion star, accretion disk, accretion stream and disk corona. This causes detectable X-rays and UV from these structures which are orbital phase dependent. Modelling of the orbital-phase dependent light curves in multiple energy band will be used to map these structures in the binary system. Time delays between the pulsations in the different energy bands will enable extraction of line-of-sight travel time delays and distances. The expected scientific results are: i) to obtain the geometry of the X-ray heating of HZ Her, the accretion disk, the accretion stream and the corona; and ii) to precisely determine the inclination of the binary. The improved system inclination will allow precise binary parameters and result in a well-determined neutron star mass.",Reg,dleahy,T01,Her X-1,16 57 49.810,35 20 32.399,24200.0,sxt

The high spatial resolution of UVIT will yield outstanding data on the stellar populations of M31. The spatial resolution of SXT is sufficient to resolve the X-ray source populations which includes measuring the supernova remnant population.

Such properties and transitions are poorly observed for low accretion rates. 4U 1724-30, being a rare low-luminosity, persistent source, which shows broadband X-ray spectrum covering the entire AstroSat range, varieties of timing features, and state transitions, is one of the best sources to study accretion processes in the low accretion rate regime. Our proposed three AstroSat observations of 4U 1724-30, each of 10 ks, will find this fluctuating source in different states, and will be useful to study their spectral and timing properties and their transitions. This will advance the knowledge of the low accretion rate regime, and will characterize this less studied source. This proposal relies on the unique broadband and timing capabilities of AstroSat.",monitoring,sudip,T01,4U 1724-30,17 27 33.250,-30 48 7.400,30000.0,sxt

A02_046,Multiwavelength spectral variability in ultra-luminous X-ray source Holmberg II X-1: testing the irradiated disk and the donor star,"Despite intensive studies of the ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) both in X-rays and in optical, there is still no strong and obvious evidence to distinguish among two competitive models: whether they contain stellar-mass or intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). What we know exactly is that the ULXs are close binary systems with massive donors. We propose to test the components of the ULX binaries. Recent data show that both UV and optical emissions may be reprocessed in strong heating by X-rays, where UV-optical spectral energy distribution hints at two-component spectra. We propose simultaneous observations of the X-ray variable ULX Holmberg II X-1 with ASTROSAT to test the UV and optical responses to the X-ray variability. Our mail goal is to study correlations between the X-ray-UV-optical data, and to elucidate the model as either a donor and supercritical accretion disk, or a donor and standard irradiative accretion disk with IMBH.",Reg,rita,T01,Holmberg-II X-I,08 18 09.7,+70 41 51.5,10000.0,uvit1

These RL-NLS1s exhibit intra-night optical variability and 1H 0323+342 is also detected in gamma-ray with Fermi-LAT. Our aim is to understand the emission mechanisms in RL-NLS1s by studying components characterizing broad-band spectra and multi-band variability. The simultaneous UV to hard X-ray data from AstroSat combined with co-ordinated optical, IR data (from Mt. Abu) and radio data (from GMRT) will allow us to make first attempt to study these RL-NLS1s with simultaneous multiwavelength observations across radio to hard X-rays. In order to obtain spectra with good signal-to-noise ratio we request 80 ks observation for each source, and thus a total observing time of 240 ks (~ 67 hours).",Reg,veeresh,T01,B3 1702+457,17 03 30.4,+45 40 47,75000.0,sxt
A02_058,Star-forming S0 galaxies in the nearby universe,"Understanding the precise star-formation history of galaxies and its dependence on galaxy mass, morphology and environment is one of the most important outstanding problems in galaxy evolution. UV data, which are the most precise probe of (relatively unobscured) recent star-formation are crucial to resolving degeneracies in the modeling. For nearby galaxies of large angular size, such modeling can be carried out for individual star-forming regions. For this purpose, the unprecended angular resolution of UVIT is critically required. In this pilot study, we request UVIT observations of 5 nearby S0 galaxies, which show some evidence of recent star-formation. We will combine the UVIT UV data with archival observations in optical, near-IR and mid-IR and stellar population synthesis models to model the resolved star-formation histories of these galaxies.",Reg,omkar,T02,NGC 4262,12 19 30.582,14 52 39.780,3000.0,uvit1

The spectrum is modeled with multi-temperature black body along with a Compton tail in the high intensity state. Objectives and Expected scientific results : We would like to study the correlated spectral and temporal variation of the source as source traverses a Z track in CCD. We propose to study the cross-correlation functions of energy dependent light curves (i.e. 3-5 keV vs 10-20 keV, 20-50 keV). We would like to explore the auto-correlation functions in various energy bands inorder to constrain the reprocessing models.

A02_065,Catching the prototype of transitional millisecond pulsars in its next accretion outburst,"The recent discovery of swings between an accretion powered (X-ray) and a rotation powered (radio) pulsar state from the transient IGR J18245-2452 in the globular cluster M28 proved the evolutionary link shared by these two classes of sources, and showed that transitions between these two regimes can take place over timescales as short as a few weeks, depending on the variations of the mass accretion rate. IGR J18245-2452 also showed dramatic variations of the X-ray flux on a shorter timescale, possibly due to propeller centrifugal inhibition of accretion. These properties make it the ideal case to study the disk-magnetosphere interaction around a fast pulsar. We propose an anticipated ToO 60 ks observation of IGR J18245-2452 during the next outburst of the source, to measure the long term spin and orbital evolution of the pulsar, and follow its correlated magnitude-spectral variability over a broad 0.3-80 keV band.",AToO,mbagchi,T01,IGR J18245-2452,18 24 32.500,-24 52 7.799,30000.0,laxpc1

We have multi-wavelength data from XMM-Newton,SDSS,WISE and UKIDSS/2MASS for a sample of type~1 AGN including Mrk~0926, one among the hardest X-ray sources in the sample. Though EPIC-pn data are available, the energy coverage is limited to 0.2-10~keV. The proposed observation will help us to extend our study by including X-ray data from 0.3-80~keV.The simultaneous multi-wavelength capability of ASTROSAT can better constrain the SED fit with UVIT observations in the optical/UV band, in addition to SDSS data. The modelling will be done using the self-consistent energy-conserving model optxagnf which can accurately determine the bolometric luminosity and well constrain parameters like Eddington-ratio and hard X-ray photon index.These observations will also help to study the short time-scale spectral variability of the source in the UV and X-ray bands.",Reg,savithri,T01,Mrk 0926,23 4 43.49,-8 41 8.52,15000.0,uvit1
A02_071,Exploring the iron line - kHz QPO connection,"The nature of the ultra-dense matter in neutron stars remains enigmatic and there is still a wide variety of possible internal compositions. Obtaining accurate radii and masses for neutron stars will allow to distinguish between these equations of state. We have suggested a powerful way to constrain both neutron star radii and masses by combining a measure of the inner disk radius from broad iron emission lines and the frequency of kHz quasi-periodic brightness oscillations (QPOs). However, this method only works if both phenomena originate from the same part of the disk. Here, we propose 30 ks observations of each of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries GX 349+2 and GX 340+0 to simultaneously obtain an accurate measure of the inner disk radius from broadband spectroscopy and the kHz QPO frequency from timing.",Reg,sudip,T01,GX 349+2,17 5 44.490,-36 25 23.099,30000.0,sxt
A02_073,Star formation in galaxies falling into clusters,"Defying traditional wisdom, several star-forming galaxies have been discovered in galaxy clusters in the last decade. These galaxies are a rare class of transition objects ``caught in the act"", and therefore provide essential clues for understanding the evolution of galaxies from being actively star-forming spirals and irregulars in the sparse environments, to passively-evolving spheroids in the core of groups and clusters. We propose to observe 4 such star-forming galaxies falling into clusters identified by their distorted morphology in far ultraviolet images. We intend to image these galaxies with UVIT. Together with the ancillary optical and infrared data, and complimentary 21 cm imaging proposed for the GMRT, we will use the Astrosat data to explore the extent of the tidal tails and the impact of gas loss on the morphology of the infalling galaxies. We will also study star formation efficiency in these galaxies undergoing tidal stress.",Reg,smriti,T02,PGC 36406,11 43 13.09,+20 00 17.36,12000.0,uvit1

Investigation of spin period evolution of the pulsar imply the surface magnetic field to be ~10^14 G, comparable to that of magnetars. However, recent observational results are in disagreement with the magnetar nature of the X-ray source. Reports of detection of a cyclotron line at ~30 keV in the spectrum of 4U 2206+54 remains debatable till date.

A02_103,Investigating the origin of the X-ray seed photons and probing rapid X-ray variability from Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 3227,"We propose four observations (each three weeks apart) of the rapidly variable Seyfert 1.5 galaxy NGC 3227, each of 40 ks. NGC 3227 has an average accretion rate (0.5% Eddington) similar to that at which Cygnus X-1 changes from harder-when-brighter to softer-when-brighter behaviour. Cyg X-1 has a total spectrum consisting of two powerlaws. The harder powerlaw is driven by synchrotron seed photons from the X-ray emitting corona and the soft by blackbody photons from the accretion disc. However rms spectra show only one, soft, powerlaw. Here, with total and rms spectra from each of the 4 observations at different flux levels, we will test whether NGC 3227 shows the same behaviour. Previous Suzaku observations hinted at similar two powerlaw total spectra but provided no rms spectra. Astrosat has far superior spectral coverage, particularly above 10 keV, allowing far better discrimination between powerlaws and the reflection components which confused earlier work.",monitoring,mayukh3107,T01,NGC 3227,10 23 30.570,19 51 54.299,80000.0,laxpc1

This source has shown X-ray luminescence and pulsations during low mass transfer periods in multiple observations despite the fact that at very low accretion rates, spherical accretion is expected to be inhibited due to the propeller effect of the spinning neutron star. Given the presence of pulsations during some of the quiescent phase observations, which in turn indicate accretion onto the polar caps, we expect the presence of cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSF) too (at ~ 45 keV ) during quiescence, which though have not been seen yet. Probing this with ASTROSAT’s higher sensitivity in the CRSF energies, would enable constraining the low mass accretion and magnetic field configurations during quiescence. This will also allow measurement of the hard X-ray pulsations in quiescence for the first time.",Reg,nirmal,T01,1A 0535+26,05 38 54.573,26 18 56.83,30000.0,laxpc1

This is the first accreting binary system in M 31, for which the spin-period has been identified. We request a 50 ks observation using LAXPC instrument on ASTROSAT. The main objective of this proposal is to detect pulsations and carry out an energy resolved pulse profile analysis. There are ~200 accreting pulsars in our galaxy. Some of the persistent pulsars are very luminous and some transient pulsars can reach very high luminosities like 10^37ergss^-1. On an average there is more than one bright transient at any instant.

Radio halos have been proposed to be generated by (re-)acceleration of fossil relativistic electrons in the ICM by MHD-turbulence injected during cluster mergers. Joint radio and X-ray studies are essential to study the radio halos and their origin. We propose X-ray observations of the galaxy cluster Abell 3535 in the Shapley supercluster which is an unusual ``low mass cluster with a candidate radio halo'' emission. We have deep radio observations with the MWA, GMRT and the JVLA for the cluster and propose Astrosat X-ray observations.

Apart from a weak correlation between luminosity and cyclotron line energy reported in Fürst (2014), persistent Supergiant HMXB systems (SgHMXBs) have not been studied systematically to note if such variations exist. We propose three observations of 15 kiloseconds each with ASTROSAT of a persistent SgHMXB (Cen X-3) with a large range of flux variations. This study will enable comparisons between wind fed SgHMXBs and disk accreting Be transients in terms of their cyclotron lines and how they are formed in the accretion column above the neutron star. Our proposal is of a monitoring kind to study variabilities with higher requested exposure times at different times and we cannot do the desired science with observations already done by ASTROSAT in GT phase.",monitoring,nirmal,T01,Cen X-3,11 21 15.79,-60 37 22.80,45000.0,laxpc1

PKS~0208-512 is one such source which shows at least an order of magnitude lower $\gamma$-ray flux level during six years of Fermi operation in comparison to the averaged flux level detected by EGRET. Along with the long term variability, PKS~0208-512 also showed the short term variability (relatively much lower amplitude) in optical and X-ray region in the low $\gamma$-ray emission state. To understand the radiative process in sources at their low $\gamma$-ray activity state, observations in UV and soft X-ray band are crucial. Thus, we propose simultaneous observation of PKS~0208-512 with UVIT, SXT along with LAXPC and CZTI detectors on board ASTROSAT satellite which is essential to construct the broadband spectra of the source and to better understand the physical process responsible for such long term low $\gamma$-ray activity state.",Reg,debbijoy,T01,PKS 0208-512,2 10 46.200,-51 1 1.884,16030.0,uvit1

Both the sources have unusual spectral behavior as compared to the other black hole binaries. LMC X-1 has never entered the hard state, whereas LMC X-3 has exhibited occasional prolonged excursions to the hard state. Study of both the sources with AstroSat will be helpful in their detailed spectral and timing studies. Therefore, observations of the two sources are proposed here, each with an exposure of 50 ks.

Ultra faint dwarf satellite galaxies around Milky Way are thought to be the first galaxies that were formed in the universe. Recent, large photometric surveys were successful in detecting new faint satellite galaxies around Milky Way and partly alleviating the so called ”missing satellite problem”. However, very little is known about their formation epoch and star formation history and evolution. UV observations are useful probes of stellar populations that might have had different chemical history, through its additional sensitivity to probe helium abundance and metallicities, compared to optical colours. We propose here UV, visible and X-ray observations of Reticulum-II, one of the faint dwarf satellites and a dark matter dominated system. There were recent claims of gamma ray detection in Ret-II, as a signature of dark matter annihilation, hence any X-ray observations may be interesting.",Reg,sivarani,T01,Reticulum 2,03 35 36,-54 03 00,35000.0,uvit2

The angle between the line-of sight and the rotational axis of the accretion disk is approximately 60 degrees. Due to the high inclination this source produces absorption lines which are useful to decipher the chemical, physical and kinematical properties of the accreting structure. Our aim is to observe this source over a wide range of X-ray energy (0.3-150) keV and study the broadband spectrum, timing properties such as QPOs, thermonuclear bursts and later do detail spectroscopic modelling.

However, due to dissimilarities of this low intensity state from other eclipsing binaries, we propose a 100 kilosec observation of this source, with SXT, LAXPC and CZTI instrument of ASTROSAT to unveil true nature of this partial eclipse. With this observation, we also aim to carry out pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of this system, to study in detail the complex double peaked pulse profiles observed in a Suzaku observation of this source.

XTE J1710-281 is an eclipsing binary and has been persistently active since its discovery. The main goal of these observations will be to determine the mid eclipse times of the source and thereby study the orbital evolution in XTE J1710-281. This will enable us to better understand the probable cause for the observed orbital glitches in the source. Along with full eclipses, this source also displays thermonuclear X-ray bursts and pre-eclipse dips. In order to study the X-ray emission mechanism, we will perform the broadband spectroscopy with SXT and LAXPC during non-burst persistent, non-dip phase, as well as during the dips.

Pulse phase resolved polarization measurements of Crab will be helpful in constraining the pulsar emission mechanism models and geometry. We have obtained statistically significant polarization signature for Crab from the available CZTI data (~550 ks) when averaged over all phases. These observations also have provided very interesting results for polarization of pulsed emission with phase-resolved polarization analysis, which can provide insights to the pulsar emission models. However the statistical significance of these results are rather low and in order to make concrete interpretation of these results it is necessary to have much larger exposure time (~2 Ms). As the requirement of this large exposure time can not be met in a single observation cycle, we expect to achieve this over the mission life time.

Polarization measurements in hard X-rays during different states along with the broadband spectral measurements with AstroSat will be able to constrain these different models.

In optical region the extreme helium stars (hot hydrogen deficient stars) (EHe) show very similar spectral energy distributions as normal O and B stars. Thus it is not easy to distinguish them except through high resolution spectroscopy. This limitation severely restricted the number of stars known as well as searches for them in older stellar aggregates which are very important consideration for estimating their life times and evolutionary considerations. Atmospheric models of EHe stars show that even though the optical colours are the same as normal stars the UVIT band colours are clearly different.

A03_120,Joint AstroSat/XMM-Newton reverberation mapping of NGC~5273: Testing the accretion disk theory,"We propose to measure time-lag, as a function of wavelength, between the optical/UV and X-rays and verify if the NGC5273 hosts standard disks. AstroSat's capability of simultaneous observations in multiple optical/UV bands and X-rays is uniquely suited for this technique. Recent Swift monitoring of five AGN have resulted in the best ever measurement of AGN X-ray/UV/optical inter-band lags, showing that optical/UV short timescale variability is mostly due to reprocessing of X-rays by an accretion disc. However the lags are ~3 times longer than expected from a standard disc. There seems to be some issue with our understanding of accretion discs.

It has very recently returned to it’s previous ‘normal’ state when it exhibit outbursts. With the proposed observation we would like to probe if the accretion mode is same as before by studying (i) the pulse profile over a wide energy band (ii) the broad band X-ray spectrum before and after the period of predicted outburst. To achieve this, we propose two 40 ks of observation of EXO 2030+375 during and after the peak of the outburst, the timing of which is predictable. We will investigate if the accretion and/or emission characteristics of the source has changed during the renewed activity after the quiescence of several orbital cycles Broad-band spectral as well as timing properties will be studied with LAXPC, SXT and CZTI.",Reg,pragatipradhan,T01,EXO 2030+375,20 32 15.28,37 38 14.9,60000.0,laxpc1

A03_127,Accretion and Mass-loss Properties of Magellanic Cloud Supersoft Sources,"Supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) are highly luminous low-kT X-ray sources, interpreted as a accreting white dwarf  at a very high rate, leading to Eddington-limited, steady H-burning on the WD surface at T~15-80 eV. Reprocessing of this emission in the disc and companion leads to high optical/UV fluxes. Maintaining the high ${\dot{M}}_{\odot}$ requires either a high mass donor (for $P_{orb}>6$hrs) or extreme irradiation of a low-mass donor to drive a wind ($<$6hrs). There are two eclipsing SSS in the Magellanic Clouds: 1E0035.4-7230, also known as 2E0035.4-7229 (SMC, P=4.1h), CAL87 (LMC, P=10.6h) for which ASTROSAT is ideal for obtaining simultanoeus full-cycle orbital light-curves in the UV/soft X-rays for the first time, so as to model the disc, disc-wind and SSS components. This has the potential to resolve the controversy over whether the mass-ratio is inverted (high-mass donors) or similar to CVs (low-mass donors), and is important given their candidacy as SNIa progenitors.",Reg,gulabd,T02,CAL87,5 46 46.540,-71 8 53.902,30000.0,sxt

The presence/ absence of cyclotron line can be tested with high sensitivity instruments onboard {\it Astrosat}. Furthermore, the causes of rapid spectral variability or flares like episodes on long and short time scales will be explored in detail.

The existence of strong winds and the interaction of the winds from both the massive stars are considered to be the primary reason of the high energy emission (from X-rays to gamma-rays) from this class of objects. But physical mechanisms of the generation of high energy emission from such systems are still under debate, as the nature of the high energy emission from massive binaries is not clear. The X-ray spectra for massive binaries are usually dominated by the thermal emission within energy range 0.2 - 12.0 keV. The nature of the hard X-ray is unknown.

The dearth of globular clusters with single population stars, i.e. only the first generation (FG) stars is attributed to factors such as cluster expansion due to primordial gas expulsion, mass loss of SNII ejecta or accretion history of Milky Way. Through this proposal, we plan to investigate two FG rich globular clusters: E3 and NGC 5024 for their UV characterisation. The former is believed to be comprised of a single stellar population while the latter has significantly large population of FG stars.

We propose broadband monitoring of NGC 2110 using three 20 ks exposures each with a gap of one year. Being very bright and variable, such monitoring of NGC 2110 would provide a unique opportunity to probe the nature and timescale of the absorption induced variability of the complex absorber, hard X-ray emitting coronal properties and the nature of soft X-ray emission over a year timescale.",monitoring,mayukh3107,T01,NGC 2110,5 52 11.404,-7 27 22.230,60000.0,sxt

Tidal tails would be expected to have UV emission from the stellar population that was ejected from the disk during the tidal interaction.",Reg,tashley,T02,IC 10_T02,00 20 23.57,+59 12 22.66,6000.0,uvit1
A04_066,Exploring Star Formation and Dust in the Magellanic Bridge,"Requested observation: One pointing in a Magellanic-Bridge GALEX-selected field. Context: Hot massive stars drive the chemical and dynamical evolution of their host galaxies, with feedback from their supersonic winds and supernova explosions, and copious yield of processed elements during their fast evolutionary time-scales. Their red-shifted UV light dominates the luminosity of distant objects. Understanding their evolution, especially at low metallicity, is key to interpret data of resolved and unresolved stellar populations. Current theories suffer from significant uncertainties, due to insufficient observational constraints. Objectives & Expected scientific results: UVIT imaging of a Magellanic-Bridge field, where GALEX shows abundance of hot stars, will uniquely enable us to derive a conclusive characterization of the young stellar population and dust. The proximity and stellar density of the field are ideal for a detailed mapping with UVIT resolution, complete for earliest-to-intermediate spectral types, and probing hot evolved objects for the first time.",Reg,lbianchi,T01,MB field1,02 07 46,-74 32 58,22640.0,uvit2
A04_067,THE DEEP UV OBSERVATION OF DUAL NUCLEI GALAXY MRK 212,"We propose to do deep UV imaging of the merging galaxy MRK 212. The system shows dual cores and extended emission from tidal-tails at multi-wavelengths. We have observed MRK 212 in UVIT cycle A02 for 1.5 Ks. Our preliminary UVIT image has better resolution compared to GALEX. But the UV emission from outer disk and tidal tails are not detected. Hence we need deeper observations. The galaxy has been observed for ~9 Ks by GALEX. We estimate that a 15 Ks UVIT observation of MRK 212 will enable us to resolve the star-forming regions around the nuclei, the disk and tidal tails. We have studied the nuclei in MRK 212 using archival VLA radio data and found that one core is an active galactic nucleus while the other core could be an AGN or a star-forming region. We have obtained EVLA observing time to confirm the nature of the cores.",Reg,rubinur,T01,MRK 212,12 28 15.280,44 27 10.901,15000.0,uvit1

A secondary priority is observations in the ""soft"" spectral state, where radius-expansion bursts are expected, and from which we can constrain the source distance.

The object’s brightness and LAXPC’s capability of measuring time lags as small as few tens of milli-seconds can be harnessed to study frequency resolved time lags and its energy dependence. The analysis of timelags and cross correlation functions will be used to analyse the relation between different energy bands, which in turn will help to understand radiative processes and accretion flow properties. A systematic search will be made to detect kHz QPO which has been detected in RXTE data of the object.

Recent Swift monitoring of a handful of AGN with low relative accretion rates reveal that the variations in optical/UV emission are caused by reprocessing of X-rays in the disk and the optical/UV lags are about 3 times longer than that expected for standard Shakura-Sunyaev disks. Measurement of optical/UV lags in high accretion rate AGN is lacking. We propose to measure time-lag, as a function of wavelength, between the optical/UV and X-ray emission, in a low mass, high accretion rate, bright and nearly absorption-free narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk1044.

However, at shorter timescales (~hr) optical-UV variability may be due to intrinsic fluctuation in coronal X-rays and reprocessing of the X-rays at the disk. In that case we expect to observe fluctuation in the optical-UV emission of 3C 111 following that at the X-rays by a few hours. We plan to test this hypothesis with the proposed Astrosat observations and simultaneous ground based optical monitoring. Furthermore, the nature of soft-hard X-ray time lag (if any), and relative variability at X-ray and optical bands may help constrain the size and location of the corona.",Reg,ritaban,T01,3C 111,04 18 21.3,38 01 36.0,50000.0,sxt

Two characteristics that make IGR J13020–6359 unique are its persistent nature yet a strong, steady spin up for the last 20 years. In the standard theory of accretion onto high magnetic field neutron stars, steady spin up should result from either a high X-ray luminosity or a very low magnetic field strength of the neutron star.

We therefore propose to carry out a systematic analysis of the SF properties of a sample of AGN on physical scales of hundreds of parsecs down to the lowest physical extent allowable by the resolution of UVIT.

A04_180,GRS 1915+105 multiwavelength fast variability,"In recent years, the study of the correlated X-ray/OIR fast variability in black-hole transients (BHTs) is showing more and more promising results. GRS 1915+105 was one of the first BHTs to be studied with a multi-wavelength approach, showing the first strong evidences for a disk-jet connection. As of today, only few X- ray-OIR simultaneous observations have been reported of this source. We therefore propose to participate with ASTROSAT to an already approved multi-wavelength observing campaign to study the X-ray-IR fast variability, together with XMM-Newton and VLT, in order to cover the hard X-ray band.

These stars belong to wide binary systems with separations greater than 1 kau. PDS 11 and LDS 5606 are the only wide binaries in the Galaxy where both the components host active accretion discs. The age of these classical T Tauri stars are older than 10 Myr. It has been considered that the disc in young stellar objects like PDS11 get disrupted over a period of 6 Myr. Accretion rates estimated from UV excess are considered more precise compared to Ha. We propose to estimate UV excess from observations using UVIT to confirm whether the binary companions of these stars are actively accreting.

The X-ray pulsations in this system is detected even at $L_{x}\sim10^{33}~erg~s^{-1}$, the lowest luminosity ever reached by an accreting pulsar with pulsed emission in quiescence. At outburst peaks, the X-ray luminosity reaches $(0.6 - 1.0) \times10^{37}~erg~s^{-1}$. In past, the pulsar had shown phases of rapid spin-up/spin-down during outbursts. From the rapid spin-up of the pulsar, an indirect estimation of magnetic field $\sim10^{12}$~G implies a cyclotron line near 10-20~keV. However, such features were not found from previous observations. The broad-band coverage of Astrosat would help us in direct estimation of magnetic field in the pulsar for first time with detection of cyclotron lines in the spectra.

We will further probe their radio luminosities and corresponding ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities for suspected correlations. The inferred properties and results from this study will be compared with the known observed properties of typical NLS1s.

SXT and LAXPC instruments will provide unprecedented spectral coverage of the synchrotron peak and beyond, which help to constrain the peak securely. Previous observation results of Mrk~180 had shown an evidence of departure of the X-ray spectrum from a power law shape, which is an indication of the spectral curvature. The broadband X-ray coverage of AstroSat can confirm the presence of such curvature. Optical/UV observation with UVIT will give an important piece of information regarding the complex multi-wavelength variability behaviour and origin of the low energy emission. By modelling the broadband SED, which can be obtained from the simultaneous multi-wavelength observation of AstroSat along with {\it Fermi}, we will be able to constrain the physical parameters which provide useful information regarding the underlying physical processes.",Reg,jitheshthejus,T01,Mrk 180,11 36 26.4,+70 09 27,40000.0,sxt
A05_068,M67: A census of WDs hidden in binaries and chromospherically active stars.,"M67 cluster is known to have a wide variety of stars which are not supported by the single star evolutionary theory. The most famous among them are the blue straggler stars (BSS), along with the sub-subgiants and yellow stragglers. Mass transfer (MT) in a binary system is the favoured formation mechanism for these stars in open clusters. If these stars indeed are of MT origin, then their expected to have the presence of donor, as an evolved primary star. The detection and identification of evolutionary state of the donor is thus crucial to confirm MT pathway of the formation of these systems. Gosnell et al. (2015) found that about 20% of BSS are formed recently in the old open cluter NGC 188, by detecting hot WD companions using the HST FUV observations.

It has very high accretion rate and exhibits rapid variability in the optical to X-ray bands. Despite these peculiar properties, the source has never been probed in detail. Using the capabilities of \textit{AstroSat}, we intend to probe the mechanism that drives the observed rapid variability as a test of the standard accretion disk theory of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This is especially important because recent \textit{Swift} monitorings have shown that while the optical/UV variability of AGNs mostly results from reprocessing of X-rays in the disk, the measured lags are about three times longer than predicted. We will also check for Comptonisation lags where seed UV photons are upscattered into X-rays in the corona. The expected lag time-scales are $\sim10-15\,\mathrm{ks}$. To achieve these goals, we request $20\,\mathrm{ks}$ observing time for \rm{Mrk 382} with UVIT as the primary instrument.%",Reg,adegoke,T01,mrk 382,7 55 25.296,39 11 10.140,20000.0,uvit1

Our goal is to study in detail the spectral behaviour of Mrk 501 in hard X-rays and TeV gamma rays, combining observations of ASTROSAT and the TeV-instrument FACT. Given the low state of the source for more than three years in both energy bands, we expect to study the low state with unprecedented precision. As the source is generally variable, splitting up the observation provides the possibility to measure and compare different flux states. A comparison with historical high-state data is planned as well. Including optical and GeV data, broad-band spectral energy distributions will be compiled and modeled. This will allow for conclusions on the still highly debated emission mechanism and a comparison of the dominant processes for low and high state.",Reg,Daniela,T01,Mrk 501,16 53 52.217,+39 45 36.61,30000.0,sxt

Over the last ten years, our outlook of similar age and metallicity for GC system got modified to a range of ages varying from young ($\sim$ 2 Gyr) to old ($\sim$ 13 Gyr). Studies confirmed the presence of multiple main sequence tracks (multiple stellar populations-MPs) in Galactic GCs, which expanded to extragalactic systems such as M31 and NGC 5128. Compared to age estimations from spectroscopic indices, UV-optical colours provide robust age estimations for MPs in GCs (Bianchi et al. 2007). Using the best possible high-resolution instrument, UVIT onboard ASTROSAT, we propose to study the ETGs in Leo II group. With the aid of UV data in addition to optical, we plan to confirm the presence of MPs in Leo II and precise age estimation.",Reg,sreeja,T01,NGC3607,11 16 54.6,+18 03 06,10000.0,uvit1

We request 45 ks observation time in total for 3 pointings for 15 ks each, at epochs separated by 15 and 30 days after the first observation. The synchrotron emission of this source shows a mild curvature in UV/X-ray energy band which deviates from a simple power-law model. To investigate the origin of the spectral curvature and the synchrotron spectral behaviour, we developed a model where the escape probability of the electron from an acceleration region is assumed to be energy dependent. The resultant synchrotron spectrum can be successfully fitted with this semi-analytical model. The combined UV and SXT observations are significant to resolve the synchrotron peak of the source. The simultaneous broadband ASTROSAT observations will be very crucial to perform the detailed study of our model, which provides better insight into the physics of blazar jets.",monitoring,Pranjupriya,T01,PKS 2155-304,21 58 52.06511,-30 13 32.1182,45000.0,sxt

It is a unique AMXP that shows double peaked pulse profiles during its outbursts and most importantly, it shows uncommonly strong harmonic content that, together with the known inclination, suggests that it might be the best source to date to set constraints on neutron star properties including compactness and geometry. To further explore this possibility we propose to observe the next outburst of Swift J1749.4–2807 with 40 ksec. We aim at performing pulse profile evolution study and to model these pulse profiles to constrain Equation of State (EOS) models.

We reported the most sensitive measurement to date of polarization for Crab with CZT-Imager, when averaged over all phases. Estimated degree of polarization is ~ 32.7% with polarization angle ~143.5¿ . Analysis of polarization fraction and angle as function of pulse phase confirmed the higher polarization fraction in off-pulse and showed and indication of variation of po- larization properties within off-pulse emission. The data also hint at a swing of polarization angles across pulse peaks.

The aim of the proposal is to use the wide-band X-ray capability of the AstroSat to characterize the precise spectral shape of X-ray emission and study its intensity variability simultaneously in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, nuv and fuv bands. Modelling the SED would probe the location and nature of acceleration processes in the source. Deep exposure in X-rays help to study the presence of transient absorption towards the X-ray source. Simultaneous deep exposures in the UVIT will map and characterize its host galaxy and the galaxies in its neighbourhood in nuv and fuv bands.",Reg,KPSingh19,T01,1H 2354-315,23 59 7.910,-30 37 40.690,60000.0,sxt

Mkn~478 is highly variable source and showed flux variation which is not associated with spectral properties. With the proposed observation, we will be able investigate the short-term variability of the source in the X-ray and UV band. The precise determination of the variation is useful in understanding the origin of UV-optical variability and the relationship between the emission in different bands provides important insights to the nature of the source. The simultaneous multi-wavelength coverage of AstroSat helps to construct the broadband SED of the source and constrain the key parameters such as Eddington ratio $L/L_{Edd}$, UV and X-ray spectral slopes, which is crucial in understanding the observed properties of Mkn~478.",Reg,samuzal_astrosat,T01,Mkn 478,14 42 07.40,+35 26 23.00,30000.0,sxt

Despite these studies, there are certain aspects of X-ray emission which are not understood well. Different models suggest different origin of hard X-ray emission; some models favour Compton scattering in Corona alone and some predict contribution of Synchrotron emission from the jets. Polarization measurements in X-rays is expected to provide some insights into this aspect. For CZTI on-board AstroSat, which is capable of polarization measurements above 100 keV, Cygnus X-1 is a potential target. Polarization measurements along with broad band spectrum of Cygnus X-1 will be able to put better constraints on the origin of hard X-ray emission. In particular, polarization measurement in hard state of the BHB would be of much interest.

A05_198,Monitoring of MCG-2-58-22 via multi-wavelength Astrosat observations,"The emission from Active Galactic nuclei (AGN) vary on different timescales throughout the electromagnetic spectrum. The strong optical-UV-X-ray variability in AGN are often inter-connected. We plan to monitor the variability pattern of the Seyfert 1.5 galaxy MCG-2-58-22 by simultaneously observing it with UVIT, SXT and LAXPC through 4 pointings. We have been alloted each pointing to be of 20 ks with SXT as the primary instrument. The observations will enable us to understand the relationship between the UV-X-ray emission mechanisms, and the geometry of the emitting regions. MCG-2-58-22 is one of the brightest Seyferts and it is surprising that for such a bright Seyfert, it is much less observed than the other sources in its class. It has not been observed a lot and has never been monitored over the broad UV-Xray band. Thus its Astrosat observation monitoring will be the 1st for the source.",monitoring,astrosat2susmita,T01,MCG-2-58-22,23 4 43.478,-8 41 8.628,80000.0,sxt
A05_199,Reverberation mapping of NGC 4051,"Swift observations of lags between the X-ray and UV/optical bands in AGN show that most of the UV/optical variability is driven by reprocessing of X-rays by a surrounding disc. However the implied disc sizes are bigger than expected, there is an excess lag in the U-band, possibly from the BLR, and a large excess lag between the X-rays and UV, possibly from scattering obscuration in the inner disc. Disc temperature may explain these discrepancies as a higher temperature leads to a more inflated inner disc and hence more scattering obscuration and a more distant BLR hence larger U-band excess. Cooler discs will be more clumpy and appear bigger. Unfortunately, most AGN observed by Swift have been of similar disc temperature. We, therefore, ask to measure lags in NGC4051, with a hotter disc, to determine whether the temperature is the critical parameter. NGC4051 is perfectly suited to observations with ASTROSAT.",Reg,imh,T01,NGC 4051,12 3 9.614,44 31 52.788,60000.0,uvit1

The synchrotron component peaks at ~ 100 keV keV; however, the source was not detected at very high energy indicating a possible curvature in the gamma-ray spectra. The redshift of z=0.087 suggests the VHE spectral curvature due to absorption by extragalactic background light may not be very significant. The synchrotron component of the source is very prominent with peak at hard X-ray. The lack of soft X-ray spectra in the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) hamper to identify the exact curvature around the peak. We plan a through study of the X-ray spectral curvature, which in turn can highlight about the diffusive processes in the jet. In addition, a broad band spectral modelling using Fermi will possibly answer the peculiar behaviour of the Compton sub-dominance of the source.",Reg,sithajagan,T01,PKS 0352-686,03 52 57.510,-68 31 16.80,40000.0,sxt

Using additional archival light curves, we shall precisely determine the X-ray power spectral density (PSD) at hours to years timescales. We shall search for any characteristic timescale (e.g., a break) in the PSD and hence test if such patterns translate from the accretion disk to jet. This work will help put additional constraints on the disk-jet connection in AGN. We have indeed found a break in the PSD using similar observation of Mrk 421 in Cycle AO2. Further observation is crucial to determine if the PSD shape remains constant and to draw stronger conclusions about physical cause of the break.

We propose a 50ks ASTROSAT observation to be performed with SXT, LAXPC and CZTI simultaneously and aiming to i) detect the pulsation, ii) obtain a precise spin frequency value to infer, for the first time, a direct measurement of the spin increased by the accretion of angular momentum with respect to the observation of 2016 April, iii) investigate the broad-band (0.3-150 keV) spectrum to study the accretion disk properties.

A05_216,Probing the origin of UV emission and the disk/jet connection in the ultra-low luminosity LINER M81,"A peculiar characteristic of the nearby AGN M81 is that the central supermassive black hole accretes at the Eddington fraction of $\sim$10$^{-5}$. At such an ultralow accretion rate, the standard accretion disk is assumed to truncate at large radii and the accretion takes place via advection-dominated, hot flow. However, such scenarios cannot satisfactorily answer `What is the origin of UV emissions and variability in these systems? Is it the jet base or reprocessing from the truncated disk?'' With the proposed UV/X-ray simultaneous monitoring of M81 for 50 ks, we can provide answers by measuring the X-ray/UV lag and its nature. A lag timescale of the order of days favors outer disk reprocessing while a lag of ks timescale favors jet origin of UV variability. Therefore, the proposed observation will allow us to test the `jet model'' that assume broadband emission during ultralow accretion is due to the jet alone.",Reg,mayukh3107,T01,M81,9 55 33.173,69 3 55.044,50000.0,uvit1

A05_229,Multiwavelength spectral and temporal features of persistent LMXBs: A probe into X-ray reprocessing,"A plethora of X-ray spectral and timing features with UV counterparts are seen during the periodic evolution of persistently accreting LMXB, which make them ideal test beds for studying dense matter and strong gravity physics. We aim to study the reprocessing of X-ray photons into UV, in order to address pertinent questions on, the mechanism behind the evolution of accretion flow, QPO frequencies, disc-coronal interaction, as the sources traverse through their evolutionary tracks in the Hardness Intensity Diagrams. The results from these observations would also allow for a thorough test of the paradigm for reprocessing of X-ray thermonuclear bursts. Sco X-1 being a Z-type source and 4U 1728-34 being an atoll source allow us to discuss various models in different evolutionary settings. We request to observe the evolution of Sco X-1 throughout its Z-track for a duration of 175 ks, and the thermonuclear bursting source 4U 1728-34 for 90 ks.",Reg,navinsridhar,T02,4U 1728-34,17 31 58.001,-33 50 7.008,90000.0,laxpc1

A06_006,[LEGACY]: AstroSat-UVIT Deep Field Legacy Survey,"We propose AstroSat-UVIT Deep Field Legacy (AUDFL) survey for two deep fields covering the GOODS-South and North using its far-ultraviolet imaging camera. Such a deep wide-field FUV observation is essential to finding compact, low-mass-star-forming galaxies (LSFGs) that are potential Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers at the intermediate redshift range. Detection of LyC leakers holds the key to our understanding of the level of ionizing radiation in our universe - playing a major role in the cosmological modelling of galaxy formation. Currently, there has been no direct detection of such sources between redshift ~ 0.5 - 2.5. Based on the data analysis of previous UVIT deep field, and proposed 190 kilosec observation, we will be in a position to detect several LyC leakers in that redshift-window and construct their space density. We will also construct multi-wavelength SEDs from FUV-to-IR and study the physical properties e.g., stellar-population, age and metallicity of these LSFGs.",Reg,sntandon,T01,AUDFLs,03 32 29.69,-27 44 07.31,75000.0,uvit1

J1808 is a Rosetta Stone system showing the evolutionary role of accretion in spinning neutron stars up to millisecond (ms) spin periods in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) to form ms radio pulsars. The observed X-ray pulsations originate from the neutron star&#39;&#39;s surface, allowing pulse-shape analyses to determine the star&#39;&#39;s mass and radius, which could allow the equation of state of ultra-dense nuclear matter to be constrained. The pulsations are only visible when the AMXP is in a bright state (outburst). We propose to observe J1808 for 40ks during its next outburst, allowing us to measure its spectrum and pulse shapes.

These stars include Blue Stragglers Stars(BSSs), yellow stragglers, sub-subgiants, and FUV bright stars. The most common mechanism of formation of BSSs in open clusters is Mass Transfer(MT) in binaries, which leaves a WD companion behind. Many of the above-mentioned types of stars are also speculated to be post-MT products. Long exposure multi-filter FUV UVIT observations of NGC2506 are proposed to detect and characterize the WD companions hidden in binaries and are crucial to lighten the formation pathways and details of MT processes in close binaries. The Sun-like stars near the turn-off of NGC2506 are expected to be magnetically active.

At high-redshifts, directly addressing this question is hampered by the opacity of the intervening IGM which blocks the transmission of Lyman continuum (LyC) flux. Recently, lower redshift studies have suggested that the best indicator of LyC escape is strong [OIII] emission. For the first time, we are now in a position to conduct a systematic search for LyC flux from a [OIII] selected sample at a redshift of z=1. This redshift regime is low enough to be largely unaffected by the intervening IGM, yet high enough to exhibit strong nebular emission typical of the high-redshift universe.

The emission is thought to be due to gas accretion from the intergalactic medium or due to the interaction between galaxies. We propose to image two pairs of interacting galaxies NGC 4438/35 and NGC 4625/18. The GALEX observations of these galaxies were not able to resolve the star-forming regions in the outer disks and interacting regions completely. But the high spatial resolution of UVIT will enable us to do this. Our target galaxies are the brightest interacting XUV galaxies in the GALEX sample. These observations will help us understand the nature of the XUV star formation in these galaxies and how it compares with type II (accretion induced) star formation. To achieve our goals we have requested for a total of 20ks UVIT observations for these two targets.,Reg,Rahnapt,T01,NGC 4438,12 27 45.5938,+13 00 31.775,10000.0,uvit1

What we know exactly is that the ULXs are close binary systems with massive donors whose UV and optical emissions seem to be reprocessed in strong heating by X-rays. We propose simultaneous observations of the highly variable ULX Holmberg II X-1 with ASTROSAT (FUV/SXT/LAXPC) to test the UV responses to the X-ray variability. Observations should reveal the system properties and structure of the binary components and their irradiated surfaces. Our previous 3 epochs of observations with SXT and UVIT/FUV show possible correlation between UV and X-ray fluxes, which indicates a binary with the stellar-mass black hole with a supercritical disk rather than a binary with IMBH.

These observations are important to analyse data of faint sources like AGNs, Blazars, etc., whose count rates are less than 10% of the LAXPC instrument background.

The signatures of the interactions/assembly process in the scales of dwarf galaxies can be better studied in low-density environment where the effects of nearby massive galaxies are minimal. To understand galaxy interactions in smaller scales and associated star formation, we propose a UV study of three dwarf galaxy pairs, which are found to have undergone/on-going interactions, in Lynx-Cancer Void region. From UVIT observations we plan to (i) identify the star forming knots, estimate their sizes and explore their spatial distribution and (ii) trace tidal features around these systems. These metal-poor and gas-rich dwarf systems which resemble systems in high redshift can provide valuable insights to our understanding of the hierarchical galaxy assembly processes.

Simultaneous SXT and UVIT observations from {\it AstroSat} will provide an opportunity to check X-ray/UV correlation in order to support the findings from {\it XMM-Newton} results.

A07_097,The enigmatic UV/X-ray connection in NGC7469,"At low accretion rate, most UV variations can be explained by reprocessing of X-ray radiation by an accretion disk, with UV/optical lagging the X-rays. However, the X-ray/UV relationship seems to disappear in AGN with very high accretion rates e.g., 1H0707-495. Is the disc structure different at high accretion rates? NGC7469, at close to the Eddington accretion rate, is a famous enigma, showing a UV LEAD over the X-rays. However when long timescale variations are filtered out, we believe there is a weak UV lag, consistent with a component of reprocessed radiation. Here we propose for two-week long AstroSat observations to study this enigma. We aim to (i) confirm and investigate the nature of UV lead by studying FUV grating and soft X-ray spectral variations, (ii) find signatures of X-ray reprocessing and wavelength dependent time lag, (iii) test the disk Comptonization model for the soft excess and resulting far UV deficit.",Reg,gulabd,T01,NGC7469,23 3 15.674,8 52 25.280,300000.0,sxt

This is caused by the precessing accretion disk, which blocks direct emission from the neutron star during the low states, and partially blocks the emission during short high state. The X-ray orbital light curve is very different in main high, short high and low states. This is caused by the different orientation of the disk, which changes the X-ray illumination of the different structures in the binary system.

An X-ray observation around this region is very much required to establish the SNR origin of the above findings. We aim to detect the source in X-ray using SXT.

The extreme-ultraviolet properties of O-type stars have never been observed directly anywhere in the Universe. The Sunburst Arc is a newly discovered, gravitationally lensed starburst galaxy at redshift 2.4 with confirmed bright ionizing emission, which makes it the only known target for which such observations are possible with current facilities. These observations will be the first ever of the extreme UV continuum of hot stars at rest-frame $\lambda \sim 400$ Å. These observations can help constrain the extreme-UV SED of massive O and B stars for the first time, testing theoretical models of stellar populations and ISM ionization.",Reg,thriveth,T01,Sunburst Arc,15 46 52.80,-78 12 51.10,125000.0,uvit1

We request here UVIT-FUV observations of N49 and N49B. Both SNRs are x-ray bright, have a small extent (< 3arcmin x 3arcmin), with a shell like morphology, and have been detected in the Galex-NUV band. At 4800 yr, the metal rich N49 is a young SNRs, associated with the magnetar SGR 0526–66. The Chandra image shows intricate morphology, with a bullet-like ejecta rich in Si and S, which is possibly a metal rich stellar fragment of the supernova progenitor. The, older (~10^4 yr), more fragmented, but unusually Mg-rich, N49B has a possible jet-driven origin of the supernova event itself. The FUV observations will link the gap between regions of optical and x-ray emission, and the multiwaveband coverage will provide a more complete picture of the progenitor event and its interaction with the CSM.",Reg,fsutaria,T01,N49 N49B,05 26 49.912,-66 05 42.99,11300.0,uvit1

A09_033,Investigating the FUV excess emission in the extended outer disk of early-type disk galaxies -II,We propose to deeply observe one lenticular and one early-type spiral (ETSs) galaxies hosting excess UV emission (XUV) in their outer disks in order to study the nature of extended disk star formation. The excess UV emission is thought to be due to gas accretion from the intergalactic medium or due to the interaction between galaxies. The shallow GALEX (Galaxy Evolution Explorer) observations of these galaxies were not able to resolve the extended UV structure and star-forming regions in their outer disks. The deep and high spatial resolution of UVIT observations will enable us to reveal these faint features. To achieve our goals we have requested for a total of 40ks new UVIT observations of 2 early-type disk galaxies.

But identification and characterization of non-interacting black holes is elusive, especially in the field stellar population.

At high-redshifts, directly addressing this question is hampered by the opacity of the intervening IGM which blocks the transmission of Lyman continuum (LyC) flux. Recently, lower redshift studies have suggested that the best indicator of LyC escape is strong [OIII] emission. For the first time, we are now in a position to conduct a systematic search for LyC flux from a [OIII] selected sample at a redshift of z=1. This redshift regime is low enough to be largely unaffected by the intervening IGM, yet high enough to exhibit strong nebular emission typical of the high- redshift universe. We propose a deep AstroSat FUV imaging survey to measure the LyC escape fraction for a sample of 146 [OIII] emitters at z=1.1.",Reg,isakwold,T01,EGS,14 19 04,+52 52 12,50100.0,uvit1

They confirmed the higher polarization fraction in off-pulse region, and also hinted at a swing of polarization angles across pulse peaks, which is not compatible with any of the existing models. However, in order to facilitate appropriate theoretical modeling, it is important to have higher significance for all features of phase-dependent polarization variation as well as their energy dependence, which requires continued Crab observations with CZTI to yield factor of 4-5 times total exposure. In this context, we propose AstroSat observation of Crab for 500 ks.

The optical/UV and X-ray observations from Swift-UVOT and XRT show strong variability in flux in day/month scale, and considerable changes in the spectral indices. The synchrotron peak lies at far-UV energies and its X-ray counterpart saturates into a hard power-law spectrum (Γ > 2.1), with negligible curvature. A rigorous timing and spectral study in terms of physical parameters is essential to quantify the intrinsic source properties and underlying physical mechanism. Hence, the spectral modelling of such variable source, true simultaneous AstroSat observations are highly required. Further, hard X-ray observations, in continuation, beyond 10–20 keV are crucial to estimate the high energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum. Besides, through this study, we intend to resolve the discrepancies seen in unknown redshift value of this source.",Reg,Pranjupriya,T01,1ES 2322-409,23 24 48.0,-40 39 36.0,40000.0,sxt

This has not been done previously. The 35-day cycle of Her X-1 consists of the sequence: high state, low state, short high state and low state. This is caused by the precessing accretion disk, which blocks direct emission from the neutron star during the low states, and partially blocks the emission during short high state. The X-ray phase-dependent light curve is very different in main high, short high and low states. This is caused by the different orientation of the disk, which changes the X-ray illumination of the different structures in the binary system.

Detecting UV emission from R Scl where the far-IR bow shock and detached shell are well separated, would enable us to disentangle their contributions. With deeper exposures and the high spatial resolution of AstroSat, we will be able to 1) examine the spatial offset between the UV and far-IR emission regions, 2) investigate these emission mechanisms, and 3) study the clumps/instabilities and their advection into the bow shock tail.

The studies previously done with {\it XMM-Newton} observations revealed that \textbf{this source is ideal one to observe strong gravitational light bending in the vicinity of its rapidly spinning black hole. We will take the advantage of simultaneous observation from SXT and LAXPC and conduct a detailed broadband spectral analysis.} This will provide us unique opportunity to conclusively establish the highly predicted strong light bending model existed in 1H 0419-577. Further, we will extend our analysis to investigate the spectral variability of the source, also, will observe how the emitted component become more and more reflection dominated as the flux drops.",Reg,samuzal_astrosat,T01,1H 0419-577,04 26 00.71,-57 12 01.77,30000.0,sxt

However, there exist few galaxies that are relatively radio weak than FR Is but more core-dominated and have jets contained within the host galaxies. These are classified as FR 0 galaxies. Fermi gamma-ray space telescope from its first four years of observations, detected one FR 0 galaxy, Tol 1326-379. Also, no other FR 0 galaxy has been detected in $\gamma$-ray band till date. To understand the radiative process in this source, we propose simultaneous observation of Tol 1326-379 with UVIT, SXT, and LAXPC detectors onboard AstroSat to construct the broadband spectra and to better understand the underlying physical processes.",Reg,kmastrosat,T01,Tol 1326-379,13 29 19.19,-38 14 18.5,15000.0,uvit1

Another goal is to study the time variability of this extreme blazar exactly at its synchrotron peak energy in order to probe the nature of the highest energy part of the particle distribution in the jet. It has been proposed to be observed by MAGIC in its upcoming cycle.

Fast time variability mainly characterised by the narrow and broad structures in the power density spectrum. The origin of the observed temporal variability components is still a controversial subject. Thus, it is crucial to understand whether the different kinds of temporal variability components arise due to the changes in the same spectral component or different ones and whether the same radiative process drives them or not. To understand this in detail, We propose simultaneous AstroSat and NICER monitoring observations of 4U~1735$-$44 and GX~340+0. For each of these sources, we request two 20 ks observations separated by a week. With these proposed observations, we will identify the different spectral states of the source and will perform correlated timing and spectral study in the broader energy band.",monitoring,jitheshthejus,T01,4U 1735-44,17 38 58.301,-44 27 0.000,40000.0,laxpc2

A10_065,Imaging very extended galaxy clusters selected from ROSAT,"The tension between the cosmological parameters derived from the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) and from cluster samples is a pressing issue. One possible discrepancy is likely the incompleteness of detected clusters is higher than estimated, and certain types of clusters or groups of galaxies were missed. The inaccuracy of the selection function will bias the corresponding mass function of galaxy clusters, and will further affect the cosmological parameter constraints. Recently, we have discovered a new set of 1308 extended clusters with flat profile by employing our state of art algorithm on the data of ROSAT All Survey (RASS). Here, we propose the 5 very extended galaxy clusters, with physical extension of more than 1 Mpc. The proposed ASTROSAT/SXT observations will not only enable us to understand the formation of extended diffuse X-ray clusters, but also explain the tension between cosmological parameter constraints.",Reg,wwxu,T04,Cluster 4,10 13 50.4,19 42 00,40000.0,sxt

A multi-wavelength study in 2017 identified a new non-thermal emission component in the source. The ongoing X-ray activity peaked in April 2020, and is predicted to continue till mid-2021. We request four {\it AstroSat} observations each of 50 ks in a montoring mode. Near-simultaneous observations in near-infrared with Mt.

At the same time, we will explore the origin of the residual star formation activity observed in ellipticals, lenticulars and in the nuclei of early-type dwarfs and low-mass, post-merger remnants. Leveraging an unprecedented multi-wavelength dataset, our proposed UVIT data will provide the definitive resource for studying the UV properties of nearby cluster galaxies.",Reg,aboselli,T99,VCC2037,12 46 15.32,10 12 19.8,12000.0,uvit1

We propose strictly simultaneous observations with AstroSat and ground-based optical/infrared timing of anticipated outbursts in 3 black hole X-ray binaries. Simultaneous multi-wavelength observations performed during an outburst will probe rapid, subsecond photometric variations and search for inter-band time delays to disentangle the jet/disc/coronal components using spectral-timing.

But identification and characterization of non-interacting black holes is elusive, especially in the sparse field stellar population.

Understanding the interplay between the AGN and recent star formation is crucial to know the role of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution. We propose to observe four Seyfert type AGN with the AstroSat/UVIT using F148W and F172M filters. The high-resolution UV imaging will provide the unique scope to understand the recent star-forming activity in the central region of these galaxies. These UVIT observations will be combined with the MUSE optical IFU data to decipher the recent star formation in the NLR region and the outflowing component of the AGN.

Understanding the interplay between the AGN and recent star formation is crucial to know the role of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution. We propose to observe four Seyfert type AGN with the AstroSat/UVIT using F148W and F172M filters. The high-resolution UV imaging will provide the unique scope to understand the recent star-forming activity in the central region of these galaxies. These UVIT observations will be combined with the MUSE optical IFU data to decipher the recent star formation in the NLR region and the outflowing component of the AGN.

A10_099,Nature of the accretion disk in a Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC~4748,"We request 80 ks {\it AstroSat} observations of NGC~4748, a narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy and one of the lowest black hole mass active galactic nucleus. This AGN exhibits strong and rapid variations in the UV/optical and X-ray bands. These variations have never been studied in detail to date in this AGN . The available observation shows dips and declining trend present in the UV and the X-ray bands. These features in the UV bands appear to be delayed on lightcrossing timescale with respect to the X-ray bands. Due to the lack of long UV/optical and X-ray observation, we propose long observation to study these variations using unprecedented multi-wavelength capability UVIT, SXT, LAXPC and CZTI instruments onboard {\it AstroSat}. The main aim of this proposal is to study the correlation between the UV/optical and the X-ray bands, and to derive the lag spectrum to study the nature of accretion disk.",Reg,mainpal,T01,NGC 4748,12 52 12.461,-13 24 52.992,80000.0,uvit1

However, only partial observations were possible. In AO4 proposal, multiband UVIT observations in NUV and FUV channels were approved; however, only NUV observations were made. In AO5 cycle, NUV monitoring observations and FUV spectroscopy of SU Lyn (for two epochs) were approved, but only single epoch FUV spectrum was provided. We analysed this partial data set (made available in November-2019) and the results are strikingly important. UVIT spectrum of SU Lyn gives the first direct proof that it is a symbiotic system of a rare class.

It is believed that the coma formation is drivenby CO/CO2 emission (observable in the FUV window). We propose to follow this comet, multiple times, as the heliocentric distance decreases, with AstroSat in the UV. Results from the ToO proposal, to image the comet in FUV will be used to get better results during the proposed observations.",Reg,aravind1192,T03,C/2017 K2,17 19 00.45,38 38 25.8,2000.0,uvit1

The results obtained from XMM-Newton observations show that the fluxes of SXE and the broad iron line increase a factor of ~ 14 and ~ 2 times respectively, with an increase in the observed UV flux a factor of ~ 2. A long AstroSat observation will be helpful to investigate the nature of the UV/X-ray variability. We request for regular pointing observation of 150 ks exposure with SXT. This will also result in ~ 90 ks UVIT data. Further, we will use the data to investigate the far UV-lag. We will also investigate the far UV/X-ray connections using time-resolved spectroscopy.",Reg,prakasht,T01,NGC 6814,19 42 40.644,-10 19 24.57,150000.0,sxt

A10_116,To understand the AGN Feedback processes in nearby LINER type galaxy NGC 1097,"Active galactic nuclei (AGN) influences the properties of the host galaxy which is termed as ''AGN feedback''. The energy from the central region can either reduce the star formation (negative feedback) or, can enhance the star formation (positive feedback). Theoretically, there are predictions for both positive and negative AGN feedback. However, observational studies of AGN feedback is very limited. A detailed observational study of the star formation properties of the inner and outer region of active galaxies will be necessary to validate/verify various theoretical predictions. Here we propose a deep UV observation of a nearby active galaxy NGC 1097 to study star formation both inner and outer part of the host galaxy. Also, observations from X-ray payloads onboard AstroSat will be used construct and model the broadband spectral energy distribution for constraining the properties of AGN.",Reg,anantha912,T01,NGC 1097,02 46 19.05,-30 16 29.6,40000.0,uvit1

(Anticipated ToO),"GRS 1739-278 and H 1743-322 are transient galactic black hole binaries presently in quiescent state. We are expecting these sources to go into outburst as seen from their past activity which reveal that their recurrence timescale of outburst is 3-4 years. Our anticipated campaign will help us to explore the emission mechanisms of these source during its early evolution phase and possible transition of spectral states. The large effective area of the LAXPC will allow the analysis of fast temporal variability of the source at high energies. We will be able to study the energy dependent variability properties such as time lag, QPOs, hardness-intensity variation, fractional RMS etc., and broadband (0.3-80 keV) spectral evolution during the different phases of outbursts. We propose to observe both sources for 25 ksec each with interval of 2 days from beginning of the outburst during the AstroSat visibility with LAXPC as the primary instrument.",AToO,tilak,T01,GRS 1739-278,17 42 40.03,-27 44 52.70,25000.0,laxpc2

C04_008,Characterizing off-axis imaging and spectral response of CZT Imager,"CZT Imager is an imaging spectroscopic instrument with fov of 4.8 degx4.8deg. As there are slight offsets between the boresights of different instruments on-board AstroSat, depending on the primary instrument of a given observation, the off-axis angle of the source for CZTI will be different, hence response of CZTI for each observation will be different. During previous cycles, few observations of standard calibration source, Crab was made with CZTI, which is used to characterize the alignment of coded-mask, imaging, and the spectral response of the instrument. However, most of these observations were along the boresight of CZTI. In order to verify these results and to validate the response matrix at off-axis angles, we propose an off-axis observation of crab. Hence we propose 21 ks observation of Crab at off-axis angle of 0.205 degree in this calibration cycle, such that the source close to on-axis in quadrant 2 of CZTI.",Reg,arrao,T01,Crab Offset,05 33 42.72,22 00 54,21000.0,czt1

The prominent and resolvable emission lines of Si to Fe emitted due to thermal gas in the remnant provide a set of standard lines which are well enough to standardize the CCD based spectroscopic systems. The earlier observations of CAS A has already helped us in refining the calibration of SXT in aforesaid band. The emission lines from CAS A combined with it small size (vis-a-vis SXT psf) of 2 arcmin and sufficient brightness, make it the best target for monitoring the spectral response of the CCD: gain calibration and the effective area in the high energies 2-8 keV.

G05_102,"X-ray timing of LMXB XTE J1710–281: Unusual Orbital Evolution, Dips and Thermonuclear Bursts","The LMXB XTE J1710–281 is located at a distance of ~15 kpc and has an edge on inclination. It is one of the very few LMXBs, where sharp and complete X-ray eclipses have been observed thereby making it easy to monitor with X-ray detectors. Eclipse timing studies have shown an unusual behaviour: The orbital period solution has three distinct epochs of orbital period separated by glitches (Jain et al. 2010). In spite of having several interesting features like thermonuclear X-ray bursts and pre-eclipse dips XTE J1710–281 has been poorly explored. The dips are attributed to occultations of the central X-ray source by structures in the outer regions of the accretion disk as seen in many other high inclination LMXBs. With the proposed observation we plan to carry out a study of the orbital evolution of XTE J1710–281, spectroscopic study of the dips, and timing/spectral studies of the thermonuclear bursts.",Reg,bpaul,T01,XTE J1710-281,17 10 12.30,-28 07 54.0,40000.0,laxpc1

SW J2000.6+3210 is however one X-ray pulsar which, inspite of being a Be X-ray binary does not show flares during it’s periastron passage. Hence, it introduces a new class of ‘persistent’ Be XRBs. This behaviour of SWJ2000.6+3210 is unexplained by the current theories. The X-ray spectrum of this source has a very high blackbody temperature (~ 1.2 keV). This allows to probe into the origin of the soft excess in pulsars very efficiently. An observation time of 50 ks will allow us to perform a detailed timing and spectral study of the source.

The statistical quality of the MAXI–GSC observation was limited, hence we could not carry out detailed investigations of the characteristics of the accretion stream. We propose a 40 kilosec observation of GX 301–2 with the SXT and LAXPC instruments onboard ASTROSAT with the aim of studying the accretion stream characteristic of the X-ray binary system. The observation should be done in the orbital phase range of 0.1–0.3, where we previously found maximum anistropy in the circumstellar matter distribution, indicating the presence of the accretion stream behind the neutron star.

It shows flares uncorrelated with it’s periastron passage and has a very long spin period. The flaring could possibly be due to the presence of clumps in the neutron star surroundings or an interplay of magnetic/centrifugal gating mechanisms. We aim to perform a detailed timing and spectral study of 4U 2206+54 with LAXPC and SXT and probe the environs of the neutron. The neutron star has a very high blackbody temperature which would allow us to study the soft X-ray excess in details. We will also investigate a previously reported weak cyclotron line at ~30 keV which would provide an estimate of the magnetic field. The large effective area of LAXPC will also allow us to study the unusually long pulse period of this pulsar with greater accuracy and characterize the spin down of the pulsar.,Reg,bpaul,T01,4U 2206+54,22 07 56.24,+54 31 06.4,40000.0,laxpc1

It is believed to be an Accretion Disk Corona (ADC) source. X-ray eclipse measurement provides us an opportunity to study the extent of the X-ray corona.

Therefore, broadband characteristic of the observation will also provide us for the first time, the detail on the energy dependence of the pulse profiles.

However, various models of high energy emission processes commonly idenfied by the regions of emission have characteristics energy dependece of the pulse profile in the soft to hard X-ray band. Therefore, detailed knowledge of energy dependence of the X-ray pulse profile of the young rotation powered pulsars is key to investigate pulsar high energy phenomena.

Modelling of the wideband spectral data of various classes (if observed) will be carried out using the physical model, which is a four parameter solution (i.e., Keplerian rate, sub-Keplerian rate, mass of the black hole and size of the Compton corona).

G05_219,Testing the standard disk model with the variable optical/UV/X-ray emission from NGC4593 [Replaces G05_004],"Recent monitoring observations of NGC5548 and NGC4395 have shown that the optical/UV variability is dominated by the reprocessed emission from an accretion disk. However, the sizes inferred from measured time delays are much larger compared to the standard disks. Observations of additional AGN with different Eddington ratio are required before we doubt on the theory of standard disks or we investigate the reason for larger time lags. The bright AGN NGC4593 with BH mass nearly an order of magnitude smaller than NGC5548 is well suited for the purpose as the expected delays are only a fraction of a day. We propose for a long 120ks (duration ~ 3.5days) Astrosat multi-wavelength observation of NGC4395. In addition to testing the disk model, the long observation will also allow to determine high energy continuum of NGC4395 as it is one of the very bright Seyfert with the 14-195keV flux of 9e-11 cgs.",Reg,dipankar,T01,NGC4593,12 39 39.492,-5 20 39.160,120000.0,czt1
G05_221,Luminosity dependence of phase-resolved cyclotron line features in High Mass X-ray Binary pulsar [resub G05_099] GX 301-2,GX 301-2 is a very bright high mass binary X-ray pulsar with a Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature (henceforth CRSF) at ~ 35 keV. It shows an extremely stable orbital flux modulation during which the X-ray flux varies by a factor of more than ten in the hard X-ray band. Observation of this source with Suzaku mission have shown a very clear pulse phase dependence of the CRSF feature during the low intensity phase of the binary orbit. We propose 80 ks Astrosat observations at higher intensity phases to investigate the changes in the accretion column/mound structure and resulting changes in the pulse phase dependence of the cyclotron line parameters. The proposed observation will provide us with crucial tests of the models describing structure of the accretion column/mound in X-ray pulsars and the process and geometrical dependence of the cyclotron line formation through a pulse phase resolved study.

G05_222,Understanding the recent star formation in nearby star forming galaxies,"The star formation in galaxies are governed by a number of processes, such as spiral arms, galactic bars, bubbles and supernovae shocks etc. The dominant process is found to vary from galaxy to galaxy. These signatures can be traced only by the very young population. Tracers like H$_\alpha$ are extensively used for 10Myr population. Evolution up to a few 100 Myr is necessary to understand the propagation of star formation. The UV fluxes are one of the best proxies to trace and estimate ages of young population, especially in regions of low metallicity. The resolution of UVIT will immensely help us to resolve star formation knots and estimate their flux. This study takes advantage of both the spatial resolution as well as the filter system of the UVIT. As a pilot study, we plan to observe two galaxies to understand the processes which govern the recent star formation.",Reg,annapurni,T01,WLM,0 1 58.162,-15 27 39.348,12030.0,uvit1

Due to detection of X-ray eclipses and short orbital period (¿6.3 hr), this source is believed to be a low mass X-ray binary. We would like to investigate the broad-band spectral and timing properties of this object using ASTROSAT and thereby help determine whether the X-ray source is a black hole or a neutron star. Measurement of the inner radius of the accretion disk in its current quiescent state, variability in colour-colour and hardness-intensity diagram, and constraining the mass function by broadband study of the eclipse will be attempted to address this question.

G05_233,Imaging the Hubble sequence - a Survey of Nearby Galaxies,"The Hubble classification scheme was based on morphology in the visible wavelengths. Galaxy surveys produce catalogs which are classified on this basis. The morphology relates to the mix of stellar populations in the galaxy, the amount of star formation activity, and the presence of gas and dust. Deep surveys turn up larger fractions of 'peculiar' morphology since they sample shorter rest wavelengths and are looking at younger galaxies. An understanding of the UV properties of galaxies in the nearby universe is essential for comparison with distant surveys. We propose imaging using multiple filters in UVIT, which would allow us to determine the slope of the SED in the FUV and NUV as well as sample emission line signatures of star formation. The superior resolution will map star forming knots more effectively compared to GALEX. The images will also showcase UVIT capability.",Reg,askpati,T10,M 101,14 03 43.64,54 18 26.2,27290.0,uvit1
G05_234,"Star formation, morphology and evolution in Groups of Galaxies","The morphology of galaxies is seen to be distinctly dependant on star formation activity. From the ellipticals to late type spirals and irregular galaxies, the current star formation rate is seen to be increasing. For isolated galaxies, SF starts off in the cloud from which the galaxy was formed and later epochs see continued SF depending on the amount of matter left over together with enriched material from evolving stars. The internal dynamics of the galaxy determines how much this matter is converted to stars. A considerable fraction of galaxies occur in clusters and groups, where galaxies often have gravitational encounters with mergers and interactions being common. In such scenarios most, if not all, of the star formation is triggerred by these interactions. This proposal aims at understanding the SF, to map signs of interactions and to examine the ""morphological shaping"" of galaxies in such groups.",Reg,askpati,T02,HCG 56,11 32 39.6,52 56 25.0,32020.0,uvit2

The necessity of the simultaneous data with high time-cadence observations over a broad energy range, is the most challenging task. ASTROSAT, with its broad energy coverage and superior sensitivity is an ideal instrument for such studies. These studies can be further extended coordinating observations with ground based facilities.

The internal dynamics of the galaxy determines how much this matter is converted to stars.

EXO 2030+375 is a rare Be/X-ray pulsar which shows X-ray outbursts at each periastron passage of the neutron star. Earlier RXTE and Suzaku observations have shown the pulse profile to be complex at high luminosity, and smoother at lower luminosities. Broad-band spectra of EXO 2030+375 during outbursts revealed the presence of several low energy emission lines. A surprising fact is that since early 2015, the strength of these outbursts has significantly reduced and sometimes hardly any outburst is being observed at the periastron passage. In this new phase devoid of X-ray outbursts, it would be interesting to investigate the evolution of the pulse period, pulse profiles and spectral properties of the pulsar during its periastron passage at low luminosity.

As the pulsar is bright in hard X-rays and shows high intensity variation (as seen in Suzaku observation), time resolved spectroscopy at high luminosity phase with CZTI and LAXPC will provide important information on the change in cyclotron line parameters with the source luminosity. This will help in resolving uncertainties among theoretical models to explain the cyclotron line features in accretion powered X-ray pulsars.

G07_011,Imaging the Hubble sequence - a Survey of Nearby Galaxies,"The Hubble classification scheme was based on morphology in the visible wavelengths. Galaxy surveys produce catalogs which are classified on this basis. The morphology relates to the mix of stellar populations in the galaxy, the amount of star formation activity, and the presence of gas and dust. Deep surveys turn up larger fractions of 'peculiar' morphology since they sample shorter rest wavelengths and are looking at younger galaxies.

It is believed to be an Accretion Disk Corona (ADC) source. X-ray eclipse measurement provides us an opportunity to study the extent of the X-ray corona.

G08_064,Probing absorption-induced and intrinsic variability in the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC4151,"One of the outstanding issues in AGN research is the nature of soft and hard X-ray variability and their connection with the UV. It is likely that the X-ray variability below 10~keV is caused by both the variations in the absorption and the primary continuum while the variability of the hard X-rays, not affected by absorption, must be intrinsic. NGC4151 is a Seyfert 1.5 galaxy with significant absorption below few keV, and strongest hard X-ray Seyfert in the sky. Under the SXT GT programme, we request two monitoring observations of NGC~4151 each with 30ks exposure and SXT as the primary instrument. These monitoring observations will be separated by 180days. We will use these data to disentangle the absorption induced and intrinsic variations. We will also test thermal Comptonisation model by investigating correlations between the variability in the far UV and hard X-ray emission which is not affected by complex absorption.",monitoring,KPSingh19,T01,NGC4151,12 10 32.574,39 24 20.880,59998.0,sxt

We propose to measure the lags in a high accretion rate, bright and nearly absorption-free AGN Mkn110.

Crab has a featureless power law spectrum with which makes it ideal for calibrating the effective areas of instruments. Recent sensitive measurements have revealed slight variations in the absolute flux level of Crab, which makes it necessary to have simultaneous observation of the source with multiple observatories to arrive at cross-calibration among instruments.Here we propose for AstroSat observation of Crab nebula during February 18-23 during which other observatories like INTEGRAL, NuSTAR and Swift have planned crab observation campaign.

T01_157,Observing the rapid X-ray variability of neutron star LMXB XTE J1701-407 with ASTROSAT,XTE J1701-407 is a transient low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) in which kHz QPOs have been detected with very high rms ($\sim$30 \%) and large difference in the frequency of the twin kHz QPOs ($\Delta \nu \approx 380$ Hz). The source has a luminosity $\sim$0.01$L_{EDD}$ and its rms-energy relation has not been well constrained nor has the evolution of $\Delta \nu$ with the drift in the frequency of kHz QPOs. We propose to monitor this source with 6 ks observations with AstroSat/LAXPC as the primary instrument during its next outburst to understand better the rms- energy relation and evolution of $\Delta \nu$ with drift in the frequency of the kHz QPO. This proposal has been accepted in the AO2 (AO2_180).

It shows two types of outbursts: almost periodic type-I outbursts with an average peak intensity of about 100 mCrab; and rare and unpredictable giant type-II outbursts with a peak intensity of about 500 mCrab. The type-II outbursts are relatively poorly studied, and can provide a unique opportunity to probe the origin of such giant and peculiar outbursts, and hence to understand the physics of this binary system, and to study disk-magnetosphere interaction and the physics near the pulsar magnetic pole at very high intensities. Currently the source has gone into a giant type-II outburst, and our proposed 20 ks AstroSat observation will provide a rare opportunity to characterize the energy-dependent pulse profiles and broadband spectrum of the source during this outburst.",Reg,sudip,T01,GRO J1008-57,10 9 43.992,-58 17 42.000,20000.0,sxt

However there are several unresolved problems in this system one of which is the contribution jet emission in X-ray wavelengths. Polarization of X-ray emission from such sources are expected to provide a wealth of information about the emission mechanism and geometry. Polarization measurements in hard X-rays during different spectral states along with the broadband spectral measurements with Astrosat will be able to constrain different models.

Since the source is showing hardening in the X-ray spectra as per ATel #12057 and #12061, we propose for ToO observation of MAXIJ1820+070 for 60 ks using LAXPC (primary instrument) and SXT.",Reg,sneha.prakash,T01,MAXI J1820+070,18 19 60.000,7 0 0.000,60000.0,laxpc1
