In the cases studied so far, the rings around R-ETGs are generally bluer than the cores and often show active star formation. As a continuation of our ongoing survey of R_ETGs, here, we propose to carry out a deep UV imaging study of three R-ETGs, where existing GALEX images and data from other wavelengths indicate intriguing appearances and demand for deeper imaging observations. For this proposal, our sample consists of an apparently empty R-ETG, a seyfert 1 ring galaxy and an E4 ring galaxy.",reks

Several studies carried out in the past mainly used spectral shape obtained from soft X-ray spectra. AstroSat gives an unique opportunity to study spectral shape over the wider band of 0.3-100 keV, which will enable us to constrain the $\Gamma_x-L/L_{edd}$ relation. We have identified a sample of hard X-ray (Swift/BAT) selected bright Seyfert galaxies with measured mass and propose 20 ks (each) observations of four bright type 1 Seyferts to augment this sample with a precise measurement of the spectral shape. We also plan to study the short term X-ray variability in these objects.",KISHOR_NBU_APDC

This event causes change in the spectral and temporal properties of the binary system as was seen during earlier occurrence in 1995. We, therefore, propose simultaneous multi-wavelength observations for timing and spectroscopic studies in X-rays and Optical wavebands as a function of spin-period phase of the pulsar and possibly at different luminosities to investigate possible cause of such event.",Kmukerjee

However, so far these features could not be studied in a broad energy band extending below 2 keV. This can now be done with NICER and AstroSat/LAXPC, which together cover the 0.2-80 keV band, and currently the only instruments with fast X-ray timing capability. Therefore, we propose for a 50 ks of joint observations with NICER and AstroSat of the Z-type neutron star LMXB GX 17+2. These observations will provide new knowledge about kHz QPOs, thus making a significant progress in understanding the fundamental physics of neutron stars. Besides, these observations will uniquely enable the joint tracking of a Z-source state in the very soft band and the hard band for the first time.",sudip

A set of UVIT filters is selected (FUV-F2, FUV-F5, NUV-F2, NUV-F3, NUV-F5, and VIS1) to cover sensitive regions over the SED of young stellar clusters. While SITELLE provides, with a spatial resolution similar to UVIT, a measurement of the gas emission lines, the clusters’ parameters will become inputs for a photoionization code used to gather the gas properties.

Reprocessing in the surrounding envelope leads to high optical and UV fluxes. Maintaining the high $\dot{M}$ requires either a high-mass donor or extreme irradiation of a low-mass donor to drive a wind, but no direct donor observations have been made yet. In AO-3 and AO-4, we obtained SXT/FUV/NUV data of the known eclipsing SSS CAL87 (LMC, $P_{\rm orb}=10.6{\rm~hr}$) and the new SSS transient ASASSN-16oh (SMC, $P_{\rm orb}>5{\rm~d}$), demonstrating that these instruments are ideal for observing SSS. We propose to obtain similar SXT/FUV/NUV observations of five other Magellanic Cloud SSS, to undertake systematic modelling of the disc, disc-wind and SSS components for the first time. This could provide constraints on SSS evolution, which is essential in their SN~Ia progenitor candidacy.",Alida

Maintaining the high $\dot{M}$ requires either a high-mass donor or extreme irradiation of a low-mass donor to drive a wind, but no direct donor observations have been made yet. In AO-3 and AO-4, we obtained SXT/FUV/NUV data of the known eclipsing SSS CAL87 (LMC, $P_{\rm orb}=10.6{\rm~hr}$) and the new SSS transient ASASSN-16oh (SMC, $P_{\rm orb}>5{\rm~d}$), demonstrating that these instruments are ideal for observing SSS.

We propose to address this problem from UVIT observations of a sample of 7 Herbig Ae/Be stars, covering a broad spectral range from early B to late A. Such a broad range of spectral type is employed to see whether other accretion mechanisms such as disc accretion works in Herbig Be stars.

Using the capabilities of \textit{AstroSat}, we intend to probe the mechanism that drives the observed rapid variability as a test of the standard accretion disk theory of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This is especially important because recent \textit{Swift} monitorings have shown that while the optical/UV variability of AGNs mostly results from reprocessing of X-rays in the disk, the measured lags are about three times longer than predicted. We will also check for Comptonisation lags where seed UV photons are upscattered into X-rays in the corona. The expected lag time-scales are $\sim10-15\,\mathrm{ks}$. To achieve these goals, we request $20\,\mathrm{ks}$ observing time for \rm{Mrk 382} with UVIT as the primary instrument.%",adegoke

Magnetospheric accretion model was suggested as the mechanism for accretion in T Tauri stars. However, there is no clear consensus whether this model works for Herbig Ae/Be stars. We propose to address this problem from UVIT observations of a sample of 7 Herbig Ae/Be stars, covering a broad spectral range from early B to late A. Such a broad range of spectral type is employed to see whether other accretion mechanisms such as disc accretion works in Herbig Be stars. From UVIT observations in NUV and FUV bands and carefully modeling the spectral energy distribution we can identify whether UV continuum excess is seen in Herbig Ae/Be stars. The identification of UV excess confirms the fact that magnetospheric accretion model is the mechanism for accretion in Herbig Ae/Be stars.",amithgovind

However the implied disc sizes are bigger than expected, there is an excess lag in the U-band, possibly from the BLR, and a large excess lag between the X-rays and UV, possibly from scattering obscuration in the inner disc. Disc temperature may explain these discrepancies as a higher temperature leads to a more inflated inner disc and hence more scattering obscuration and a more distant BLR hence larger U-band excess. Cooler discs will be more clumpy and appear bigger. Unfortunately, most AGN observed by Swift have been of similar disc temperature. We, therefore, ask to measure lags in NGC4051, with a hotter disc, to determine whether the temperature is the critical parameter. NGC4051 is perfectly suited to observations with ASTROSAT.",imh

These sources have shown the minute scale variability in gamma-ray energies (Shukla et al. 2018; Aleksic et al. 2011), which challenges the existing standard emission models of blazars. Since AstroSat have UV, soft and hard X-ray instruments on board, it will be a great opportunity to study the variability in UV and X-ray along with simultaneous observation from Fermi at gamma-ray energies. The simultaneous observations from UVIT, SXT, LAXC and CZTI will be used to study the broad band SED, which will tell us about the physical processes happening in jets of blazars.",raj

Detection of these LyC leakers holds the key to our understanding of level of ionizing radiation in our universe-playing a major role in the cosmological modelling of galaxy formation and evolution. Currently, there has been no direct detection of such sources between redshift $z\sim0.4-2.2$, generally known as the redshift desert ($1&amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2$).

We will use these data to (i) model fit the broad band SEDs (and test current theoretical ideas about the physical properties that operate in these objects), (ii) derive bolometric luminosity, accretion rate and bolometric correction factor, (iii) study the connection between the disc emission and the shape of the X-ray continua including the soft X-ray excess, and (v) investigate any connection between the disk reflection and the thermal emission from the disc. We request 15~ksec UVIT exposure for each target to acquire good quality SEDs.",gulabd

Maintaining the high ${\dot{M}}$ requires either an evolved donor (for $P_{orb}>6$hrs) or extreme irradiation of a low-mass donor to drive a wind ($<$6hrs). Examples of both are known. From AO-3 to AO-5, we have observed four SSS with AstroSat, including the known, eclipsing SSS CAL87 (LMC, P=10.6h) and the new SSS transient ASASSN-16oh (SMC, P$\sim$5d). The FUV/SXT combination remains a unique facility for such work, making the SSS class excellent targets with which to establish Legacy datasets.

But the high spatial resolution of UVIT will enable us to do this. Our target galaxies are the brightest interacting XUV galaxies in the GALEX sample.

A rigorous timing and spectral study in terms of physical parameters is essential to quantify the intrinsic source properties and underlying physical mechanism. Hence, the spectral modelling of such variable source, true simultaneous AstroSat observations are highly required. Further, hard X-ray observations, in continuation, beyond 10–20 keV are crucial to estimate the high energy cutoff of the synchrotron spectrum. Besides, through this study, we intend to resolve the discrepancies seen in unknown redshift value of this source.",Pranjupriya

Simultaneous multi-band observation is essential to understand the emission mechanism of CSS sources and their possible linkage with giant radio-lobe galaxies. Furthermore, on-axis AGN exhibit strong intra-night optical variability (INOV) compared to their off-axis counterpart. Optical observation of Fermi CSS, 3C 380 suggests a possible presence of INOV.

However, in order to facilitate appropriate theoretical modeling, it is important to have higher significance for all features of phase-dependent polarization variation as well as their energy dependence, which requires continued Crab observations with CZTI to yield factor of 4-5 times total exposure. In this context, we propose AstroSat observation of Crab for 500 ks.

This pulsar also exhibit pulsed emission from low-frequency radio to very high energy gamma-rays. Previous studies have detected an enhanced emission in optical band at the time of occurrence of giant radio pulses from the Crab pulsar. However, no such statistically significant result has been obtained at the higher energies. This proposal aim to search for such correlations.

The energy from the central region can either reduce the star formation (negative feedback) or, can enhance the star formation (positive feedback). Theoretically, there are predictions for both positive and negative AGN feedback. However, observational studies of AGN feedback is very limited. A detailed observational study of the star formation properties of the inner and outer region of active galaxies will be necessary to validate/verify various theoretical predictions. Here we propose a deep UV observation of a nearby active galaxy NGC 1097 to study star formation both inner and outer part of the host galaxy.
